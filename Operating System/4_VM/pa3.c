 *   However, the pages populated with RW_READ only should not be accessed with
 *   RW_WRITE accesses.
 *
 * RETURN
 *   Return allocated page frame number.
 *   Return -1 if all page frames are allocated.

 *   Make sure that the next process is unlinked from the @processes, and
 *   @ptbr is set properly.
 *
 *   If there is no process with @pid in the @processes list, fork a process
 *   from the @current. This implies the forked child process should have
 *   the identical page table entry 'values' to its parent's (i.e., @current)
 *   page table. 
 *   To implement the copy-on-write feature, you should manipulate the writable
 *   bit in PTE and mapcounts for shared pages. You may use pte->private for 
 *   storing some useful information :-)
